# dotfiles

Scripts, CLIs and configuration used for my development environment.

## Install

```
git clone -C ~/projects/github.com/revett git@github.com:revett/dotfiles.git
```

```
make setup
```

Clone the repo, create symlinks, and set macOS system preferences.

## Other Projects

### Docker Images

```
make build-container-images
```

Within `docker/` are a number of wrapper container images for making local
development simpler.

### Email Filtering

```
make generate-email-filters
```

Within `email/` is an allowlist and shell script for generating a Gmail filter
that labels anything not from a trusted domain as `External`; to visually aid
with noise/spam.

## HomeBrew Package Syncing

> Warning: This is very rough-and-ready.

```
make build-hops-cli
```

```
./hops
```

The `hops` CLI is a simple Go wrapper around the macOS `brew` CLI which uses a
local `.hops.yml` file for keeping which packages are installed/uninstalled in
sync.
