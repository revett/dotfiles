# dotfiles

Scripts, CLIs and configuration used for my development environment.

## Install

```bash
make setup

Clone/download the repo, create symlinks, and set macOS system preferences.

## VS Code (Cursor) Extensions

This is now managed via the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) and `hops` bash function (see
[.functions](./.functions)).

## HomeBrew Package Syncing

This is also now managed via the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) and `hops` bash function (see
[.functions](./.functions)).
