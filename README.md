# dotfiles

Scripts, CLIs and configuration used for my development environment.

## Install

```
make setup
```

Clone/download the repo, create symlinks, and set macOS system preferences.

## Other Projects

### VS Code Extensions

```
make vscode-extensions-sync
```

```
make vscode-extensions-install
```

### Docker Images

```
make build-container-images
```

Within `docker/` are a number of wrapper container images for making local
development simpler.

### HomeBrew Package Syncing

> Warning: This is very rough-and-ready.

```
make build-hops-cli
```

```
./hops
```

The `hops` CLI is a simple Go wrapper around the macOS `brew` CLI which uses a
local `.hops.yml` file for keeping which packages are installed/uninstalled in
sync.
